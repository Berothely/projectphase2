# Phase 2 Project: Movie Industry Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå Project Overview

In this project, I explore data from various movie industry sources to uncover insights that will guide a newly launched movie studio. With the increasing trend of major companies creating original video content, our company is entering the market but lacks experience in filmmaking. The mission is to analyze what types of films perform best at the box office and translate those findings into clear, data-driven business recommendations.

The analysis draws from multiple datasets sourced from platforms such as IMDB, Box Office Mojo, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers. Given the varied formats and origins of these datasets, part of the task involves effective data cleaning and merging before meaningful analysis can begin.

## üéØ Business Context

The stakeholders for this project seek strategic insights to help decide:

- What kinds of movies (genres, runtimes, budgets) tend to perform best at the box office?
- Which release periods are most favorable?
- What characteristics are associated with successful films?

Since **producing movies is costly**, it is essential to base investment decisions on solid data.
